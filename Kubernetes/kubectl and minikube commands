minikube start/delete
minikube status
minikube dashboard

OUR FIRST DEPLOYMENT
kubectl create deployment <deployment-name> --image=<image-name:latest>
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl describe pods
kubectl delete deployment <deployment-name>
kubectl delete -f deployment <deployment-name>  

We will expose the project so that we can access it. Just like we used to bind ports 
in the case of Docker, we will do the same here so that the project can be accessed using the service.

kubectl expose deployment <deployment-name> --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer/NodePort
to check 
kubectl get service

Now that we've created the service, we still can't access it. We need to inform Minikube first, then it will 
provide us with the URL to access it.
minikube  service <service-name>
now you get a url on which your project is running

If we want to update our project, for example, if I make changes to my project and create a new image version, 
we need to know how to do this in pods.

kubectl set image deployment <deployment-name> <container-name>=<image-name>
(you can find container name in minikube dashboard)

ROLL OUT
kubectl rollout status <deploymrnt-name>

ROLLBACK 
kubectl rollout undo deployment <deployment-name>

SCALING
kubectl scale deployment <deployment-name> --replicas=3

NOW WE DO ABOVE WITH YAML FILE
CREATE A DEPLOYMENT.YAML FILE TAKE REFERENE FROM k8s.IO
kubectl apply -f <file-name.yaml>
DO SAME WITH SERVICE.YAML
AND
kubectl get service
minikube  service <service-name>
now you get a url on which your project is running
