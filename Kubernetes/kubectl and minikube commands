OUR FIRST DEPLOYMENT
kubectl create deployment <deployment-name> --image=<image-name:latest>
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
kubectl logs <pod-name>
kubectl describe pods
kubectl delete deployment <deployment-name>
  

We will expose the project so that we can access it. Just like we used to bind ports 
in the case of Docker, we will do the same here so that the project can be accessed using the service.

kubectl expose deployment <deployment-name> --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer/NodePort
to check kubectl get service

Now that we've created the service, we still can't access it. We need to inform Minikube first, then it will 
provide us with the URL to access it.
minikube  service <service-name>
now you get a url on which your project is running
